# ✅ Website Updates - Complete Summary

## 🎉 What's Been Changed

### 1. Navigation Updates ✅
- **Removed**: "Book Now" from navigation menu
- **Renamed**: "Retreats" → "Retreat" (singular)
- **Added**: "Contact Me" page to navigation

**Navigation now shows:**
- Home
- Retreat
- Contact Me

**Note**: Book Now page still exists at `/booking` - accessible via the button on Retreat page

---

### 2. New Contact Me Page ✅

**Location**: `http://localhost:3000/contact`

**Features:**
- Beautiful contact form with validation
- Fields: Name, Email, Phone (optional), Message
- Sends data to backend server
- Success/error notifications
- Contact information display:
  - Email: wildadventurecoach2233@gmail.com
  - Instagram: @wildadventurecoach
  - Location: Rocky Mountains, Colorado

**How It Works:**
- Form submissions are logged to your **server terminal** (where you run `npm run server`)
- You'll see each message with name, email, phone, and message content
- User gets success notification

**To Receive Emails Instead of Console Logs:**
- See `CONTACT_FORM_NOTES.md` for Gmail or SendGrid setup
- Takes 5 minutes to configure
